CV Project
==

This project is a repository for my *curriculum vitae*.  It is based on the example presented by Ethan White, and inspired in part by the post [Ten reasons you should put altmetrics on your CV right now](http://blog.impactstory.org/altmetrics-on-a-cv/) on the ImpactStory website. Obviously, although inspired by others, this CV contains my own publications and information.

In part it is an attempt to integrate dynamic links directly into my CV, and to provide a central location for the document.  Previously I created (semi)monthly updates to my CV in Microsoft Word.  Here I maintain version control and can directly update the CV and output it to a PDF or Word format though PanDoc.
